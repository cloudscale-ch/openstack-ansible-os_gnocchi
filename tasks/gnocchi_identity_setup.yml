# Create the project if needed, assumed to be in default domain.
# In many cases this will be present but under some circumstances the project
# may be unique to Gnocchi, esp. when Swift is used for storage.
# We set the python interpreter to the ansible runtime venv if
# the delegation is to localhost so that we get access to the
# appropriate python libraries in that venv. If the delegation
# is to another host, we assume that it is accessible by the
# system python instead.
